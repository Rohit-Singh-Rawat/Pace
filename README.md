## 1. Project Initialization

- [X] **Set Up Version Control**
  - [X] Initialize a Git repository to manage the codebase and track changes effectively.
  - [X] Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from version control.

- [X] **Initialize the React Native Project with Expo**
  - [X] Install Expo CLI globally.
  - [X] Create a new Expo project named `fitness-tracker-app`.
  - [X] Navigate to the project directory.

- [X] **Initialize the Golang Backend**
  - [X] Install Golang on your development machine.
  - [X] Set up the project structure for the backend.
  - [X] Initialize a new Go module for dependency management.
